### Multiserver support, added by Roland Kaltefleiter, which requiers
### only ONE Proceess, set this to on, to enable, default is no.
### This option requirs a bind to ANY (server-addr = * )
### The files for the virtual servers will be put below 
### database-dir/HEX-IP/, that means the IP-Number of each interface
### will be added to the pathname, (using %lx format).
### ATTENTION: This is architecture depended, e.g localhost, 127.0.0.1
### will give 7f000001 on sparc, but 0100007f on intel !!!!
### We now have a more readable support: mode-dotted = yes, which
### will use IP-numbers in dotted notation (a.b.c.d) and not as a hex-string :-)

# rkmultimode = no

### Software virtual servers as defined in HTTP/1.1
### If you use this, you need to take real care if you use some of
### the proxy code, since a local request might be 'GET http://host/path HTTP/1.0'
### The virtualhostname is put behind the Server root.
### In combination with 'rkmultimode', rkmultimode comes first, and then
### software-virtual-server. So a documentroot will then be like:
### /home/www/docs/c1626e12/www.netuse.de/
### Warning: software-virtual-server is verified for the modules:
### dir.so file.so cgi.so map.so
### Wont'work: All proxy code AND ncsa-html.so.
### All others: Should work, but I did not have time to verify....
#
# software-virtual-server = no

### This is only honored, if you run any hosting mode from the two above.
### Then the documentroot, which is extended by the servername/number if appended
### by this string to make the effective documentroot.
### This has advantages for putting together ftp-upload chroot and cgi-chroot in
### virtual hosting:
### e.g.:
### /home/www/docs/HEX/www.name.de/    		- FTP-Chroot 
###			here you put in dev/tcp usr/bin/ls etc. 
### /home/www/docs/HEX/www.name.de/data/	- Documentroot
### The default is the NULL-string !
### WARNING: You MUST include this sub-database-dir in your URL-patters
### in any ACCESS/AUTH tables !!!
#
# sub-database-dir = /data

### You may wanna disable this if you have problems with small files
### and images (<60 bytes) and Netscape 2.0b (there are bugs in NS2's
### handling of Keep-Alive connections and small objects).
#
# keepalive-connections = yes

### By enabling "extended-logging" you will get two extra fields in the
### requests log file, "Referer" and "User-Agent".
#
# extended-logging = yes

### Add the received and send bytes of the query and the mime-header to
### the volume written to the logging-file. Old default was NOT to add.
### The incoming header is always added (if logheadervolume==yes).
### The outgoing mimeheader is added only by the modules file and cgi.
### Other modules are in work.....
#
# logheadervolume = yes

### This will enable IP# -> Hostname lookups. This can cause a performance
### penalty even though Phttpd tries to limit the effects of it by doing
### extensive cacheing
#
# hostname-lookups = yes

### This will enable IDENT (RFC1413) queries for every incoming request.
### WARNING: This will cause a big performance penalty, even though Phttpd
### does the lookup in the background to try to limit the effects.
#
# ident-lookups = no

### (See the INSTALL file for more information about this parameter if you
###  want to set this value to anything above 5 (which you want) _and_ have
###  the OS use it! It won't hurt to have it set to this though...)
