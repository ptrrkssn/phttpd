# cgi.conf

#default-user = nobody
#default-group = nobody

### Set this to "no" to disable user CGI processes
#allow-user-cgi = yes

### Set this to "yes", to run scripts as auth user id
# run-as-authuser = no
### Or the cgi can be run by the uid of the owner of the docroot !
### This requiers "run-as-authuser = no" !
# run-as-docrootowner = no
#
### This is relevant for security, specially if using run-as-docrootowner.
### cgi will only be executed, if the uid it greater or eqal to this value.
### The default is 100 !
### In case you accedently forget to chown that dir away, this will block
### and return a 403 error.
### You can disable this feature by setting the value to -1 !
# minimum-run-uid = 100

### You can specify the use by an URL pattern:
### The value is either user  or  user:group !
### This only work, if run-as-authuser is NOT set !
### This does override default-user and default-group.

#cgi-uidgid-table = {
#        *.cgi             bin:bin
#	 *.pl		   nobody
#	 *.root		   root
#}

### The default path for CGI processes
# path = /bin:/usr/bin

### By default, '/cgi-bin/*' is retrieved from the directory
### database-dir/cgi-bin, where database-dir is taken from phttpd.conf.
### By setting cgi-basedir to a path, this value will
### replace the database-dir for the cgi's !
### Remember not to put the 'cgi-bin' into this dir, since it comes
### from the URL !
### Cannot be used with cgi-run-bin-dir in extend mode !
# cgi-basedir =

### By default phttpd will use the documentroot ( or the newroot if set)
### as the working directory for the cgi. This behaves different as all other
### servers, though it has some advantages.
### Setting cgi-run-bin-dir to '.', will first chdir to the directory, where the
### cgi is located and then run it.
### default is NO, for compatibility with former versions of this server.
### if you set cgi-run-bin-dir to any other value that '.', that will be used
### In the extended mode, realpath is used to get the path to execute befor doing the
### chdir !
### 'cgi-basedir' cannot be used the cgi-run-bin-dir in extended mode !
### newroot and cgi-run-bin-dir in extended mode will normally NOT work !
### (the realpath happens BEFOR the chroot !)
# cgi-run-bin-dir = 

### In case of authentification, $HOME dir must match the URL.
### See file.conf for more.
###
# exec-needs-homedir = 0

### The maximum number of environment variables per CGI process
# max-environ = 256

### If >0 then limits the maximum number of concurrent CGI processes to
### this number.
# max-processes = 0

### A colon-separated list of parent-process environment variables to
### copy down to to CGI processes
# copy-environ = LANG:LC_CTYPE 

### Use the value on newroot for a chroot call befor the cgi-exec.
### Default is not to do any chroot.
### One may use the table with pattern matching and %{n} expansion OR
### the standalone value newroot = !
### If a cgi-newroot-table is defined, the simple variable newroot is never used !
#cgi-newroot-table = {
#        /*/root/*         /path/%{1}/data
#}
### or you can use newroot for ALL urls in a simple setup.
# newroot = 
#
### As we are using this server for webhosting, we need way to make administration
### as simple as possible.
### This mode does only work if none the above (newroot, cgi-newroot-table) is set.
### So we will have the option, to set the newroot to the dokumentroot, which is
### a good setup. Due to the features of virtual hosting, we have 4 options:
### 1) Base documentroot == database-dir in main configuration file.
### 2) Base documentroot extended by "rkmultimode": this will be "database-dir"/IP-NR
###    This gives nice options together with software-virtual-server, since you can
###    set all those servers on the same ip-number to the same chroot.
### 3) Base documentroot extended by "svshostname": this will be "database-dir"/"www.site.com"
### 4) Effective documentroot, whith it the documentroot extended by all
###    virtual options, as set in the main configurtaion. Depending on the
###    definition of those options, this may result in the same as 1 or 2.
### 5) Effective documentroot WITH sub-database-dir. This does only work,
###    is virtualhosting (any mode) is active.
###
###                     none|basedir|extended|effective|withsubdir
### auto-newroot-mode =  0      1       2         3         4
###    

### Since servers global DOCUMENT_ROOT will probalby be wrong for a chrooted 
### cgi, you can for DOCUMENT_ROOT to a new value for the environment variable
### DOCUMENT_ROOT of the cgi-process. Setting 'cgi-database-dir' will set
### this value to DOCUMENT_ROOT IF newroot is used.
# cgi-database-dir = 

### Set a nicevalue for the CGI process
### Default is to use servers nicevalue
# nicevalue = 0
 
### Set a max-cpu-time resource limit for the CGI process
### Default is none set
# maxcputime = 
 
### Set a max-vmem resource limit for the CGI process
### Default is none set, value is given in Byte.
# max-vmem =
 
### Set a max-fd resource limit for the CGI process
### Default is none set.
# max-fd =

### Set environment variables through a table here. These values are set at the
### end, thus they will override anything else.
# set-environ = {
#    VAR1                value1
#    VAR2                value2
