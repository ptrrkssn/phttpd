Logging data with Phttpd</H2></CENTER>
Phttpd can maintain two log files, one is mainly for external use (the
CERN Common Log compatible "requests" log file), whereas the other (the
NDBM format "counting" log file(s)) is used for internal access (mainly
by the <B>NCSA-HTML</B> modules).

<P>Both are by default disabled, but can be enabled by specifying the paths
to the log files in <B>phttpd.conf</B> or from the command line.

<P>In case you are using some special features like "rkmultimode" or "software-virtual-servers"
(HTTP/1.1),
<BR>the common log is extended by some additional information.
<BR>Every daemon does ONLY&nbsp;write ONE&nbsp;logfile, so in those multiservermodes,
you need to write yourself tools
<BR>to split the common log into the seperate logs for the differnet servers.

<P>For account the server is also able to get all traffic, including incoming
data and send mimeheaders. This
<BR>options can be set in the main configuration file.
