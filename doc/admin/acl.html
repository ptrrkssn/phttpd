The ACL Handler (host-access)
</H2>

Phttpd has its own acl Handler.
The mapping between acl-files and URL is done by the host-access table in
the main configuration file. If the path to the acl-file is relative it
is taken relative to the documents root. So the webmaster can grant the privilage 
to maintain that file to the user, who is maintaining that part of the server.

# phttpd.acl
#
# The format of this file is simple, first a "key" which can be
# either "host" or "address", second is a pattern to match against
# and the last entry is either "allow" or "reject" or "auth".
# In case of auth, additional agruments are requiered: first a
# Password-Source (same way as read-authenticate) and then
# an (optional) Security-Realm.
#
# Currently only the "address" information is available inside the
# server so you can't use the "host" key for anything useful.
 
host            laphroaig.*             allow
 
address         130.236.160.9           reject
address         130.236.160.*           allow
address         130.236.*               reject
address         193.98.110.*            auth    File1   Realm
host		*			reject
</PRE>
The argument 'File1' in an auth statement refers to the mapping of the auth-handler-table in the  main configuration file.
Using this mechanism you can get the same results as with ".htaccess" files of
other WWW-servers.
