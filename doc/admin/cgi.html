The CGI module
</H2>

This module enables the use of
<A HREF="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/CGI/">
CGI (Common Gateway Interface)
</A>
compliant programs and scripts to be executed.

<H3>Example file (test.cgi)</H3>
<PRE>
	#!/bin/sh

	echo "Content-Type: text/html"
	echo ""
	echo "Hello, World"

	exit 0
</PRE>

<H3>System issues</H3>

Causes the server to close Keep-Alive sockets after the file has been
sent (since it can't depend on the "Content-Length" header being
present and/or correct).

<H3>Configuration options (cgi.conf)</H3>

<DL>

<DT><B>default-user</B> (string)
<DD>The user name or number to run global CGI scripts as. Defaults to
	user number -1 (normally "nobody"). Also sets the <B>default-group</B>
	option to the group found in the Passwd database.

<P><DT><B>default-group</B> (string)
<DD>The group name or number to run global CGI scripts as. Defaults to
	group number -1 (normally "nobody").

<P><DT><B>allow-user-cgi</B> (boolean)
<DD>If set to "false", will disable the possibilty for normal users
	to have CGI scripts in their local home pages directory.

<P><DT><B>path</B> (string)
<DD>The PATH to use for CGI scripts. Defaults to "/bin:/usr/bin".

</DL>

<H3>Example configuration file</H3>
<PRE>
# cgi.conf
 
#default-user = nobody
#default-group = nobody
 
### Set this to "no" to disable user CGI processes
#allow-user-cgi = yes
 
### Set this to "yes", to run scripts as auth user id
# run-as-authuser = no
 
### The default path for CGI processes
# path = /bin:/usr/bin
 
### By default, '/cgi-bin/*' is retrieved from the directory
### database-dir/cgi-bin, where database-dir is taken from phttpd.conf.
### By setting cgi-basedir to a path, this value will
### replace the database-dir for the cgi's !
### Remember not to put the 'cgi-bin' into this dir, since it comes
### from the URL !
# cgi-basedir =
 
### In case of authentification, $HOME dir must match the URL.
### See file.conf for more.
###
# exec-needs-homedir = 0
 
### The maximum number of environment variables per CGI process
# max-environ = 256
 
### If >0 then limits the maximum number of concurrent CGI processes to
### this number.
# max-processes = 0
 
### A colon-separated list of parent-process environment variables to
### copy down to to CGI processes
# copy-environ = LANG:LC_CTYPE 
 
### Use the value on newroot for a chroot call befor the cgi-exec.
### Default is not to do any chroot.
# newroot = 
 
### Since servers global DOCUMENT_ROOT will probalby be wrong for a chrooted 
### cgi, you can for DOCUMENT_ROOT to a new value for the environment variable
### DOCUMENT_ROOT of the cgi-process. Setting 'cgi-database-dir' will set
### this value to DOCUMENT_ROOT IF newroot is used.
# cgi-database-dir = 
 
### Set a nicevalue for the CGI process
### Default is to use servers nicevalue
# nicevalue = 0
 
### Set a max-cpu-time resource limit for the CGI process
### Default is none set
# maxcputime = 
 
### Set a max-vmem resource limit for the CGI process
### Default is none set, value is given in Byte.
# max-vmem =
 
### Set a max-fd resource limit for the CGI process
### Default is none set.
# max-fd =
 
### Set environment variables through a table here. These values are set at the
### end, thus they will override anything else.
# set-environ = {
#    VAR1                value1
#    VAR2                value2
#}
